The seat booking system project effectively demonstrates several fundamental core Java concepts, including:

1. Data Structures:
    2D Arrays: To represent the seating chart, a 2D array is used, where each element corresponds to a seat.
2. Control Flow:
    Loops: A while loop is used to allow continuous booking until the user chooses to stop.
   
    Conditional Statements: if-else statements are used to validate input, check seat availability, and book seats accordingly.
4. Input/Output:
    Scanner: To read user input for row and seat numbers.
    System.out.println: To display the seating chart and provide feedback to the user.
5. Methods:
    The code is broken down into smaller, easier-to-understand parts, making it more organized and reusable.
6. Variables and Data Types:
    Variables: Variables are used to store information such as the number of rows, seats per row, row and seat numbers, and user choices.
    Data Types: int and char data types are used to represent numbers and characters, respectively.


---By understanding and applying these core Java concepts, you can effectively build various applications, including seat booking systems.---
